    <h2 id="header" class="center-text">Summary</h2>
    <p class="center-text">
        I have three years of experience in IT - my first job was working with PBX’s and firewalls at Vale Communications,
        and my current role within Reassured ltd.’s IT department involves working with our internal IT systems.
        More recently, I’ve been involved in automating some of our processes using PowerShell scripting, and having found great enjoyment
        in using Shell as a management language, I've since brahced out into Python and working with JSON data. Having excelled at my current role,
        I’m looking for a new challenge and would like to go into software development, or anything where I can use my skills of programming and scripting,
        at an entry level, or as an apprentice. I pick up new skills very quickly, which I believe is paramount to being successful in IT at any level.

                troubleshooting software and hardware support queries, setting up laptops for 
                new starters, processing new starts and leavers and traveling to remote sites 
                to provide in person support to other offices. On top of that, I’ve created 
                PowerShell scripts to partially automate our new starter and leavers process, 
                as well as using scripts to simplify things like UPN changes and department 
                /job role changes. The new starter script has now been included in a wider 
                ongoing project to fully automate our new starter process, as the business is 
                currently on a growth drive to hire as many new starts as possible in our 
                sales departments. I’ve achieved recognition within the company through their 
                quarterly “premier club” award twice, and I am also a member of their 
                Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee, with a focus on how we can use 
                automation to improve our processes within HR, and other ways IT can be 
                involved in improving our DE&I.
